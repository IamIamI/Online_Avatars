# Online playable/rigged character meshes
Repos to dump 3D avatars for monaverse and Spatial etc in .vrm format.

Currently just dumping avatars from https://GameDisease.com .
The base meshes, rigs etc, were not made by me, but made by Frenetik Void, Milton Sanz and Oxeegeno from GD.
I just added some minor things for funz.
